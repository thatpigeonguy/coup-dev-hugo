Alright, what's happening?

I just graduated high school! :D

That's right, my legally required education has officially come to an end, and soon I'll be beginning my legally *optional* education, you know it, you love/hate it; college.

All jokes aside this is and forever will be one of the largest stepping stones in my life, and I'm not just saying that. In my previous "now", I went on a spiel about how "I've always felt like the *kid*" and "I'm now the oldest in my school" etc. Well, you can chuck all that out the window as I'm fresh meat again.

Alright, enough lollygagging, here are the usuals:

### I've been reading: *Princess of Mars*

Wonderful read that I cannot do justice in this short blurb.

### I've been listening to: Mixed things

My music has been a mixed bag recently. Been listening to a particular playlist including but not limited to: Bob Dylan, Coldplay, Ozzy Osbourne (the Ozzy-Rhandy tribute album has been particularly listened to), and a few scathered others.

### I've been playing: Kingdom: New Lands

A relatively small side-scrolling semi-fantasy game that I'd love to write a post about at somepoint. I won't spoil anything, but if you're a sucker for a classic pixel aesthetic as I am, do check it out!
