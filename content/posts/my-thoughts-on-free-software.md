If you're in any way a part of the computer science community, there's no doubt in my mind that you've heard of or even support and use free software. If you already know what I'm talking talking about, feel free to skip ahead. For those of you who don't, I'm not talking about the price of the software you're using, though no price does tend to occur, but rather but your ability to use your programs any way you like without restriction.

This philosophy has contributed greatly to society, there is no doubt about that. I, myself, even push the use of it wherever I can and encourage others to do the same. However, in recent years I've noticed a "trend" of sorts that has shifted the paradigm abruptly. The best way to describe this shift in my mind is what I call "free software extremism".

This phrase (and post in general) was somewhat inspired by Luke Smith's video entiled [Free Software Extremism isn't Far Enough](https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/w/ps4eAAeqH9sR8UVQEBybSS) as it really made me think about the practicalities of free software. And, yes, I am aware that what I'm about to discuss isnt directly the same as the video's content; the name and a few other things is what mainly inspired me here.

## What I Mean by "Free Software Extremism"

To be clear, when I use the term "free software extremism," I'm not referring to a passionate commitment to free software principles or advocating for its wider adoption. Instead, I'm pointing to a rigid, often dogmatic approach that, in my view, can become counterproductive.

You often encounter individuals whose fervent advocacy for "liberation!" from proprietary software, while well-intentioned, can manifest as a rigid expectation for *everyone* around them to adopt their choices. This often means going out of your way to completely *avoid* proprietary software, even when it creates unnecessary friction in your personal and social life.

Paradoxically, by shackling oneself to an absolute rejection of all proprietary tools, one can become bound by self-imposed limitations that restrict connection and participation. The true spirit of free software is about *living* freely and being empowered, not creating new barriers for yourself or others. The key is understanding how to unlock the the world without compromising your core values.

My goal here is not to advocate for the abandonment of free software principles or embracing a world of walled gardens. Far from it. I strongly encourage advocating for privacy-respecting platforms like Signal over conventional messaging apps including even SMS and open-source alternatives to commercial services where possible. These are excellent steps towards digital autonomy and should be pursued whenever feasible.

However, true freedom also means understanding when a pragmatic choice is necessary. If a particular proprietary program is genuinely vital for your family's communication, your professional work, or maintaining crucial social connections, an uncompromising stance risks isolating you and hindering your ability to participate effectively in the world around you. It's about finding the balance that empowers you, rather than imposes new constraints.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the powerful ethos of free software is about empowering individuals and fostering control over our digital lives. Yet, when this noble pursuit veers into the territory of extremism, it risks transforming liberation into isolation, and genuine choice into rigid dogma. True digital freedom, in my view, lies not in an unwavering, absolute adherence to a prescribed list of applications, but in the intelligent and compassionate application of principles that allow us to navigate the world effectively, maintain our vital connections, and participate fully in the society around us. Let us champion free software for the profound freedoms it genuinely offers, while also embracing the pragmatism that ensures those freedoms truly enhance, rather than hinder, our real-world lives and relationships.
