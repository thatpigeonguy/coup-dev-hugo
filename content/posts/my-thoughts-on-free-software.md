Before we begin with this one, I just want to put out a disclaimer saying **I love free software**! I love the movement, I love the community, it all really has helped me out in more ways than one and, despite a few nitpicks I'm about to get into, I am forever grateful. Just let it be known that this is my personal commentary and that it's ok if you disagree!

## Introduction

If you're in any way a part of the computer science community, there's no doubt in my mind that you've heard of or even support and use free software. I'm not talking about the price of the software you're using, though this does tend to occur, but rather but your ability to use your programs any way you like without restriction.

This philosophy has contributed greatly to society, there is no doubt about that. However, in recent years I've noticed a "trend" of sorts that has shifted the paradigm abruptly. The best way to describe this in my mind is "free software extremism".

## The Good

Before I go tearing this movement to shreds and put on Richard Stallman's watchlist, I'd like to discuss the things I like about all of this.
