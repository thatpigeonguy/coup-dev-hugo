I've been hearing a lot lately about how "the UK is killing the internet!" and "privacy is dead!" and so on and so forth. What's somewhat disappointing about this exclamation, for me at least, is that, while I still very much disagree with the new policies, most people have forgotten about tne true nature of the *inter*net, now using what I've been calling the *intra*net.

The intranet, not to be confused with 1980s office networks, is a tiny slice of anywhere from three to ten web pages from the entirety of the internet a person visits most often. These often boil down to YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, maybe Pinterest, and literally nothing else.
