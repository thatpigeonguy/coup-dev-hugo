Can I just say something? I, love the library. I mean it, too! You may not think it's that big of deal, but give me 5 minutes of your time, and I can change that.

## Books

Without reading the header, when you think of "library", what typically comes to mind? That's right, **books**! Literature, which in turn spouts knowledge, is the foundation of any prosperous society, and you will find that, both historically and modernally, prosperous societies have always had free public knowledgebases mostly containing, you guessed it, **books**.

Modern society is just the same! Nearly every town and city in the world has a public library filled with hundreds if not thousands (or [millions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Library)) of volumes, some bigger and smaller nonetheless, but libraries all the same.

"But Jonah", I hear you saying, "I hate reading". To that I say; stop it. In all seriousness, the probable reason you feel that way is likely due to some past experience. I know mine was due to those stupid *required* summer reading activities in school where they gave you like three books to chose from and you had to read the whole thing for a test grade... Jesus.

Anyway, if you're past school and would like to give it a try, talk to your librarian, they'll be more than happy to give you a push. If you are an semi-avid reader, we're moving on now!
