Some of the astute among you may have caught a small easter egg underneath my posts; a little 73. This is not a typo nor formatting error, but rather a little nod to a hobby of mine that I'm finally getting around to talking about. This is something that you have stastically never heard of.

Amateur radio, or Ham radio as we like to call it, is a licensed yet public radio service dedicated to serving the public and bettering technological skill all around.
