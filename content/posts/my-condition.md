Since I've started actively writing this blog, some people have asked me "Jonah, why don't you talk about your condition more?" and often follow it up with "you're inspiring" or something similar. And, while I am flattered by those comments, my response is usually something along the lines of "that's no *me*".

So, think of this post as me caving to peer pressure. Here, I will discuss my condition, how it has affected me and my family, and a few other small tidbits. Unless something extraordinary happens like God Himself coming down and forcing my legs back into line, don't expect much else on this topic (not that I'm opposed to talking about it, just it's not the main point of this site).
