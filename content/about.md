## Me in a nutshell

I'm just another person here, really. I live in Massachusetts with my parents, siblings, and cat. I am a defender of Christ and do tech things.

## Hobbies & Interests

**Amateur radio!** Callsign KC1UTV. Got my Technician license back in May 2024, my General in November, and have been hooked ever since. If you are also a Ham and are interested in making a QSO, [contact me](/contact)! If not, get on that!

**Programming!** Usual spiel here. I enjoy creating stuff, whether it's a game, website, or tool. Currently messing with Pygame.

**Motorsports!** Nothing much to say here. I'm always watching the current weekend's NASCAR and Formula 1 races (making me somewhat depressed in the winter), and have a unique enjoyment for monster trucks (I'm not childish, you're childish!)

## Professional

Well, I just started my college career, so I don't have too much professional experience. However, I am currently working on my degree in Cybersecurity and have a side-hustle as a web developer for a local hair salon!
