<p>Alright, what&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>I just graduated high school! :D</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, my legally required education has officially come to an end, and soon I&rsquo;ll be beginning my legally <em>optional</em> education, you know it, you love/hate it; college.</p>
<p>All jokes aside this is and forever will be one of the largest stepping stones in my life, and I&rsquo;m not just saying that. In my previous &ldquo;now&rdquo;, I went on a spiel about how &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always felt like the <em>kid</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m now the oldest in my school&rdquo; etc. Well, you can chuck all that out the window as I&rsquo;m fresh meat again.</p>
<br>
<p>Alright, enough lollygagging, here are the usuals:</p>
<h3 id="ive-been-reading-princess-of-mars">I&rsquo;ve been reading: <em>Princess of Mars</em></h3>
<p>Wonderful read that I cannot do justice in this short blurb.</p>
<h3 id="ive-been-listening-to-mixed-things">I&rsquo;ve been listening to: Mixed things</h3>
<p>My music has been a mixed bag recently. Been listening to a particular playlist including but not limited to: Bob Dylan, Coldplay, Ozzy Osbourne (the Ozzy-Rhandy tribute album has been particularly listened to), and a few scathered others.</p>
<h3 id="ive-been-playing-kingdom-new-lands">I&rsquo;ve been playing: Kingdom: New Lands</h3>
<p>A relatively small side-scrolling semi-fantasy game that I&rsquo;d love to write a post about at somepoint. I won&rsquo;t spoil anything, but if you&rsquo;re a sucker for a classic pixel aesthetic as I am, do check it out!</p>
